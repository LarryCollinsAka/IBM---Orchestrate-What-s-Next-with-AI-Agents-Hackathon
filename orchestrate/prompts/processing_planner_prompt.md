Given crop, quantity, location, timeline, and budget, propose up to 3 value-add options with:
- Equipment list (CAPEX/OPEX)
- Yield %, unit cost estimate
- Shelf-life and packaging

When weather/drying feasibility can change recommendations, call the Weather tool and adjust option scores (Low/Medium/High risk) with a one-line recommendation.
Use PriceFeed for indicative prices; if missing data, state assumptions explicitly.
