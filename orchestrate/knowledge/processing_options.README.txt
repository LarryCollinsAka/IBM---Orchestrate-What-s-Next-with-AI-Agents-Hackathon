Processing Options – Quick Playbook 

Scope: low-capex, smallholder-friendly value addition for priority crops in Nigeria, Cameroon, India.
Use: This guide is a reference for the agent’s planning step (yield, shelf-life, packaging, feasibility prompts). Costs are indicative and should be labeled as assumptions unless verified.

1) Decision Inputs (what the agent must ask/assume)


Crop & form: e.g., cassava (fresh root), maize (dry grain), rice (paddy).


Quantity & timeline: e.g., 3 tons within 7 days.


Location: nearest town/city (for weather + logistics).


Budget (capex ceiling): e.g., ≤ USD 1,000 / ≤ USD 5,000.


Target market: local retail, bulk buyer, co-op, export-prep (feasibility only).


Utilities available: power (grid/generator), clean water, shaded/covered drying area.



2) Recommended Options by Crop

⚠️ Ranges below are indicative for micro/SME setups. Always attach “assumptions” and call tools (Weather, PriceFeed, CostCalc) before final ranking.

Notes: Sun/covered drying affects feasibility; smoke/odour control for food safety; peel quality alters cyanide levels.

Notes: Aflatoxin risk—prefer properly dried grain (<13% moisture). Milling + sieve quality define texture grade.

3) Feasibility & Quality Checklist
Weather / Drying


If rain risk high next 5 days → prioritize covered/mechanical drying or wet products (e.g., ogi, fufu).


If low humidity + sun → gari, flour products are favored.


Food Safety


Moisture targets: flours ≤ 12–13%.


Aflatoxin control for maize/groundnuts—reject moldy grain.


Clean water & sanitation for wet products (ogi/fufu).


Utilities & Labour


Power (grid/genset), water access, basic PPE.


Labour availability for peeling, grating, frying, bagging.


Packaging


Wholesale: PP woven sacks (25–50 kg) with liners.


Retail: food-grade pouches (optionally oxygen barrier).



4) How the Agent Should Use This Document


Collect inputs (crop, quantity, location, timeline, budget, market).


Call tools


Weather → feasibility note (“Risk: Low/Med/High; rec: covered drying”).


CostCalc → unit cost & opex (simulate if unavailable; mark as assumption).


PriceFeed → indicative min/avg/max price for product+market.




Rank 2–3 options with a compact table:


Option | Yield/kg per 100 kg raw | Unit cost | Est margin vs. price | Feasibility note | Capex band




State assumptions clearly: data source/time, moisture targets, exchange rates.


Offer next step: BOM list, simple SOP, buyer short-list if requested.



5) Bill of Materials (starter templates)
Gari (micro)


Grater, press, fryer, sifter, trays, PP bags, pallet.


Sanitation: gloves, aprons, hairnets.


QA: moisture meter (optional), simple scale.


Maize flour (micro)


Dehuller (optional), mill, sieve, sealer, PP bags.


QA: moisture meter (optional).


Yam flour (micro)


Slicer, dryer (solar/mech), mill, sieve, sealer, PP bags.



6) Output Format (agent)
Return structure for each option:
{
  "option_name": "Gari",
  "yield_percent": 20-35,
  "unit_cost_per_kg_usd": 0.15,
  "capex_band_usd": "500-1500",
  "shelf_life": "3-6 months (dry)",
  "packaging": "25-50 kg PP bags",
  "feasibility_note": "High rain risk; use covered drying",
  "assumptions": [
    "Simulated unit cost using CostCalc v1.0",
    "Prices: PriceFeed (Ibadan) 2025-10-24"
  ]
}


7) Regional Notes (quick)


Nigeria: strong urban demand for gari, yam flour; weather variability in wet season.


Cameroon: palm/cocoa value addition viable; transport to Douala/Yaoundé hubs.


India: rice/wheat processing common; puffed rice fast-moving in retail.



8) Disclaimers


All yields/costs are indicative for micro/SME setups; validate locally.


Weather & price signals are snapshots; always include date/market.


Food regulations differ by country; ensure local compliance (labels, weights).
